# Background

-   `xcms` part of Bioconductor since 2006, *standard* toolbox for LC/GC-MS data
    preprocessing.
-   Major changes in `xcms` version > 3:
    -   re-use data structures from Bioconductor's `MSnbase` package
    -   native MSn support
    -   new functions
    -   internal changes and code cleanup


## Mass spectrometry

-   Mass spectrometry (MS) allows to measure abundances of charged ions in a
    sample.
-   Data is represented/measured in a spectrum.

![](images/MS.png)

-   Many ions with the same/similar mass-to-charge ratio m/z.
-   Additional separation of compounds by additional properties
    (hydrophob/hydrophil): liquid or gas chromatpgraphy.

![](images/LCMS.png)

-   LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics: identify *chromatographic* peaks.


## Definitions and common naming convention

-   chromatographic peak: peak containing the signal from an ion in retention time
    dimension.
-   chromatographic peak detection: process in which chromatographic peaks are
    identified within each file.
-   alignment: process that adjusts for retention time differences between files.
-   correspondence: grouping of chromatographic peaks (presumably from the same
    ion) across files.
-   feature: chromatographic peaks grouped across samples.


# Workflow: metabolomics data preprocessing using `xcms`

The workflow is focused on the **new** `xcms` interface/functions and covers:

-   Basic MS data handling (`MSnbase`)
-   Simple MS data centroiding (`MSnbase`)
-   LC-MS data pre-processing (`xcms`):
    -   chromatographic peak detection
    -   alignment
    -   correspondence
-   Not covered:
    -   data normalization
    -   compound identification
    -   differential abundance analysis


## Prerequisites

-   Rstudio
-   R version >= 3.5.0
-   Libraries:

```{r  eval = FALSE, results = "hide" }
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("xcms", "MSnbase", "doParallel", "rgl", "msdata", "magrittr",
	   "devtools"))
## Need xcms version > 3.3.1
if (packageVersion("xcms") < "3.3.1")
    devtools::install_github("sneumann/xcms", ref = "master") 
```


## Data import and representation

-   MS data can be loaded with the `readMSData` function.
-   `mode = "onDisk"` does read only header information from the files, actual m/z
    and intensity values are retrieved on demand.
-   *on-disk* mode enables analysis of very large experiments.
-   Interactive code: read the toy data set:
    -   subset from 2 files with pooled serum samples
    -   UHPLC (Agilent 1290) coupled with Q-TOF MS (TripleTOF 5600+ AB Sciex)
    -   HILIC-based chromatographic separation

```{r  load-data, message = FALSE }
library(MSnbase)
library(xcms)
library(doParallel)
library(magrittr)

## Define the file names.
fls <- dir(system.file("sciex", package = "msdata"), full.names = TRUE)

## Define a data.frame with additional information on the files.
pd <- data.frame(file = basename(fls),
		 injection_idx = c(1, 19),
		 sample = c("POOL_1", "POOL_2"),
		 group = "POOL")
data <- readMSData(fls, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame", pd),
		   mode = "onDisk") 
```

-   Parallel processing setup should be defined at the start.
-   Most functions from `xcms` and `MSnbase` are parallelized *per-file* and use the
    registered setup.
-   Interactive code: parallel processing setup.

```{r  parallel-setup, message = FALSE }
## Set up parallel processing using 3 cores
registerDoParallel(3)
register(bpstart(DoparParam()), default = TRUE) 
```

-   Data is an `OnDiskMSnExp`; access phenotype information using `pData` or `$`,
    general spectrum information using `fData`.
-   Interactive code: get to know the `OnDiskMSnExp` object.

```{r  show-fData, message = FALSE, results = "hide" }
data

## Access phenotype information
pData(data)

## Or individual columns directly using the $ operator
data$injection_idx

## Access spectrum header information
head(fData(data)) 
```

-   Note: with the data not being in memory, any data manipulation (such as
    smoothing) is never applied to the data but is performed on-the-fly.


## Basic data access and visualization

-   MS data in an `OnDiskMSnExp` object is organized by spectrum (similarly to mzML
    files).
-   Access general spectrum information with `msLevel`, `centroided`, `rtime`, `polarity`.
-   Use `fromFile` to know which values belong to which file/sample.
-   `Spectrum` object: container for m/z and intensity values.
-   Interactive code: access general spectrum information.

```{r  general-access, message = FALSE }
## Get the retention time
head(rtime(data))

## How many spectra are there?
length(rtime(data))

## Get the retention times splitted by file.
rts <- split(rtime(data), fromFile(data))

## The result is a list of length 2. The number of spectra per file can
## then be determined with
lengths(rts) 
```

-   `spectra` gets the list of all spectra (from all files). This loads the full
    data from all files, which can be slow!
-   In most cases we work with subsets anyway: use filter functions to subset the
    data:
    -   `filterFile` subset to individual files/samples.
    -   `filterRtime` restrict to specific retention time window.
    -   `filterMz` restrict to m/z range.
    -   `filterMsLevel` subset to certain MS level(s).
-   Data access will be fast on indexed mzML, mzXML and CDF files.
-   Interactive code: extract all spectra measured between 180 and 181
    seconds. Using the `%>%` (pipe) operator to avoid nested function calls.

```{r  spectra-filterRt, message = FALSE }
## Get all spectra measured between 180 and 181 seconds
## Use %>% for better readability
sps <- data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(180, 181)) %>%
    spectra

## How many spectra?
length(sps)

## From which file?
sapply(sps, fromFile) 
```

-   Interactive code: plot the data from the last spectrum

```{r  spectrum-plot, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Spectrum at a retention time of about 180 seconds." }
plot(sps[[6]]) 
```

-   Spectra represent intensities along the m/z dimension for discrete retention
    times.
-   The `chromatogram` function retrieves chromatographic data (intensities along
    the retention time axis for a certain m/z range).
-   Interactive code: get the total ion chromatogram for each file.

```{r  chromatogram, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Total ion chromatogram.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5 }
## Get chromatographic data (TIC) for an m/z slice
chr <- chromatogram(data)
chr

## Plot the tic
plot(chr) 
```

-   We have one chromatogram per file.
-   `aggregationFun` parameter allows to switch from TIC `"sum"` to BPC `"max"`.
-   Interactive code: extract ion chromatogram for Serine ([M+H]+ adduct m/z
    106.0455 matches the second largest peak in spectrum above).

```{r  serine-xic, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Extracted ion chromatogram for the Serine [M+H]+ ion." }
## Plot first the spectrum
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(mz(sps[[6]]), intensity(sps[[6]]), type = "h", xlab = "m/z",
     ylab = "intensity", main = rtime(sps[[6]]))
## Highlight the m/z range from which we extract the Serine XIC
rect(106.02, 0, 106.07, 70000, border = "#ff000040")

## Extract and plot the XIC for Serine
data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    chromatogram(aggregationFun = "max") %>%
    plot()
 
```

-   Easy to access sub-sets of the raw data.
-   `spectra` to get intensities along m/z for discrete retention time.
-   `chromatogram` to get intensities along rt for m/z range.
-   Use `rtime`, `mz`, `intensity` to access the MS values.


## Centroiding of profile MS data

-   *centroiding* is the process in which mass peaks are reduced to a single,
    representative signal, their centroids.
-   `xcms`, specifically *centWave* was designed for centroided data.
-   Proper centroiding can improve data accuracy.
-   `MSnase` provides basic tools to perform MS data smoothing and centroiding:
    `smooth` and `pickPeaks`.
-   Interactive code: show the combined m/z, rt and intensity data for Serine.

```{r  serine-profile-mode-data, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Profile data for Serine." }
## Filter the MS data to the signal from the Serine ion and plot it using
## type = "XIC"
data %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    plot(type = "XIC") 
```

-   plot `type = "XIC"` creates a combined chromatographic and *map* visualization of
    the data.
-   Interactive code: smooth data in m/z dimension using a Savitzky-Golay filter
    followed by a centroiding that simply reports the maximum signal for each mass
    peak in each spectrum. See `?pickPeaks` for more advanced options.

```{r  centroiding, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Centroided data for Serine.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5 }
## Smooth the signal, then do a simple peak picking.
data_cent <- data %>%
    smooth(method = "SavitzkyGolay", halfWindowSize = 6) %>%
    pickPeaks()

## Plot the centroided data for Serine
data_cent %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(175, 189)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.02, 106.07)) %>%
    plot(type = "XIC") 
```

-   Note: data smoothing and centroiding is applied to the data *on-the-fly*, each
    time m/z or intensity values are accessed. To make the centroiding *persistent*
    we need to export the centroided data.
-   Interactive code: export the smoothed data to new files and re-read the data.

```{r  export-centroided, message = FALSE }
## Write the centroided data to files with the same names in the current
## directory
fls_new <- basename(fileNames(data))
writeMSData(data_cent, file = fls_new)

## Read the centroided data.
data_cent <- readMSData(fls_new, pdata = new("NAnnotatedDataFrame", pd),
			mode = "onDisk") 
```


## LC-MS data preprocessing


### Chromatographic peak detection

-   Aim: identify chromatographic peaks in the data.
-   Function: `findChromPeaks`.
-   Available methods:
    -   *matchedFilter* (`MatchedFilterParam`) [@Smith:2006ic].
    -   *centWave* (`CentWaveParam`) [@Tautenhahn:2008fx].
    -   *massifquant* (`MassifquantParam`) [@Conley:2014ha].

-   CentWave is a two-step approach:
-   identify regions of interest.

![](images/centWave-ROI.png)

1.  peak detection within this regions using continuous wavelet transform (CWT).

![](images/centWave-CWT.png)

-   CentWave parameters:

```{r  centwave-help, results = "hide" }
?CentWaveParam 
```

-   Crucial parameters: `peakwidth`, `ppm`.
-   `peakwidth`: minimal and maximal expected peak width. Depends on the LC
    settings of the experiment.
-   Interactive code: extract chromatographic data for Serine and perform peak
    detection using default parameters

```{r  centWave-default, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine", results = "hide" }
## Get the XIC for serine in the first file
srn_chr <- chromatogram(data_cent, rt = c(165, 200),
			mz = c(106.03, 106.06),
			aggregationFun = "max")[1, 1]
## Plot the data
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 1))
plot(srn_chr)

## Get default centWave parameters
cwp <- CentWaveParam()

## "dry-run" peak detection on the XIC.
findChromPeaks(srn_chr, param = cwp)

cwp 
```

-   What went wrong? Default for `peakwidth` does not match the current data.
-   Interactive code: change `peakwidth` and run again.

```{r  centWave-adapted, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine with detected chromatographic peak", results = "hide" }
cwp <- CentWaveParam(peakwidth = c(2, 10))

pks <- findChromPeaks(srn_chr, param = cwp)

## Plot the data and higlight identified peak area
plot(srn_chr)
rect(pks[, "rtmin"], 0, pks[, "rtmax"], pks[, "maxo"], border = "#00000040") 
```

-   Ideally check settings on more known compounds.
-   `ppm`: maximal allowed scattering of m/z values for one ion.
-   Interactive code: evaluate the m/z scattering of the signal for Serine.

```{r  Serine-mz-scattering-plot, message = FALSE }
## Restrict the data to signal from Sering
srn <- data_cent %>%
    filterRt(rt = c(179, 186)) %>%
    filterMz(mz = c(106.04, 106.06))

## Plot the data
plot(srn, type = "XIC") 
```

-   Interactive code: calculate the difference in m/z values between consecutive
    scans.

```{r  define-ppm, message = FALSE }
## Extract the Serine data for one file as a data.frame
srn_df <- as(filterFile(srn, 1), "data.frame")
head(srn_df)

## The difference between m/z values from consecutive scans
diff(srn_df$mz)

## The same in ppm
diff(srn_df$mz) * 1e6 / mean(srn_df$mz) 
```

-   Ideally this should also be performed on more compounds.
-   `ppm` should be large enough to capture the full chromatographic peak.
-   Interactive code: perform chromatographic peak detection.

```{r  findPeaks-centWave, message = FALSE }
## Perform peak detection
cwp <- CentWaveParam(peakwidth = c(2, 10), ppm = 30)
data_cent <- findChromPeaks(data_cent, param = cwp) 
```

-   Result: `XCMSnExp` object extends the `OnDiskMSnExp`, so we can access the data in
    the same way plus it stores preprocessing results.
-   Interactive code: explore the result object.

```{r  xcmsnexp, message = FALSE, results = "hide" }
data_cent

## Access the peak detection results
head(chromPeaks(data_cent)) 
```

-   For quality assessment, we could also do some summary statistics on the
    identified peaks.
-   Interactive code: plot the location of the identified peaks in the m/z - rt
    plane.

```{r  plotChromPeaks, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Location of the identified chromatographic peaks" }
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plotChromPeaks(data_cent, 1)
plotChromPeaks(data_cent, 2) 
```


### Alignment

-   Aim: adjusts shifts in retention times between samples.
-   Interactive code: plot the base peak chromatograms of all files.

```{r  alignment-bpc-raw, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "BPC of all files", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4 }
## Extract base peak chromatograms
bpc_raw <- chromatogram(data_cent, aggregationFun = "max")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(bpc_raw) 
```

-   Function: `adjustRtime`.
-   Available methods:
    -   *peakGroups* (`PeakGroupsParam`) [@Smith:2006ic]: align samples based on
        hook peaks.
    -   *obiwarp* (`ObiwarpParam`) [@Prince:2006jj]: warps the (full) data to a
        reference sample.

-   peakGroups works reasonably well in most cases.
-   Need to define the hook peaks first: peaks present in most/all samples.
-   Important parameters:
    -   `minFraction`: proportion of samples in which a feature has to be present (0.9
        for present in 90% of samples).
    -   `span`: degree of smoothing for the loess function, 0 likely overfitting, 1
        linear regression. Values between 0.4 and 0.6 seem reasonable.
-   Interactive code: perform a peak grouping to define potential hook peaks and
    align the samples based on these.

```{r  alignment-correspondence, message = FALSE }
## Define the settings for the initial peak grouping - details for
## choices in the next section.
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8,
			minFraction = 1, binSize = 0.02)
data_cent <- groupChromPeaks(data_cent, pdp)

## Define settings for the alignment
pgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 1, span = 0.6)
data_cent <- adjustRtime(data_cent, param = pgp) 
```

-   Adjusted retention times are stored in the object.
-   Interactive code: inspect the difference between raw and adjusted retention
    times. Helps to determine whether settings were OK.

```{r  alignment-result, message = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4 }
## Plot the difference between raw and adjusted retention times
plotAdjustedRtime(data_cent) 
```

-   Evaluate alignment results:
    -   difference between raw and adjusted retention time reasonable.
    -   hook peaks along the full retention time range.
    -   comparison of BPC (TIC) before/after alignment.
    -   evaluate data for known compounds.
-   Interactive code: plot BPC before and after alignment.

```{r  bpc-raw-adjusted, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "BPC before (top) and after (bottom) alignment.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8 }
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
## Plot the raw base peak chromatogram
plot(bpc_raw)
## Plot the BPC after alignment
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, aggregationFun = "max")) 
```

-   Interactive code: plot Serine XIC before and after alignment.

```{r  serine-xic-adjusted, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "XIC for Serine before (left) and after (right) alignment", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4 }
## Use adjustedRtime parameter to access raw/adjusted retention times
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4.5, 1, 0.5))
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
		  rt = c(179, 186), adjustedRtime = FALSE))
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
		  rt = c(179, 186))) 
```

-   If we need to repeat simply remove alignment results with `dropAdjustedRtime`
    and retry.


### Correspondence

-   Aim: group signal (peaks) from the same ion across samples.
-   Function: `groupChromPeaks`.
-   Methods available:
    -   *peak density* (`PeakDensityParam`) [@Smith:2006ic].
    -   *nearest* (`NearestPeaksParam`) [@Katajamaa:2006jh].

-   peak density: 
    -   iterates through slices of m/z ranges and groups chromatographic in each if
        peaks (from same or different samples) are close in retention time.
    -   whether they are close is estimated on the distribution of peaks along the
        retention time.
-   Interactive code: plot the data for the m/z slice containing the Serine peak
    and dry-run a correspondence analysis.

```{r  correspondence-example, message = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.cap = "BPC for a m/z slice and defined features within this slice based on default settings." }
## Plot the BPC for the m/z slice containing serine
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(4, 4.3, 1, 0.5))
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06), aggregationFun = "max"))
highlightChromPeaks(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
		    whichPeaks = "apex_within")

## Get default parameters for the grouping
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group)
pdp

## Dry-run correspondence and show the results.
plotChromPeakDensity(data_cent, mz = c(106.04, 106.06),
		     type = "apex_within", param = pdp)
 
```

-   Black line shows the peak density estimate, points represent the position of
    peaks along the retention time axis per sample and grey rectangles indicate
    grouped peaks (features).
-   Parameters:
    -   `binSize`: m/z width of the bin/slice of data in which peaks are grouped.
    -   `bw` defines the smoothness of the density function.
    -   `maxFeatures`: maximum number of features to be defined in one bin.
    -   `minFraction`: minimum proportion of samples (of one group!) for which a peak
        has to be present.
    -   `minSamples`: minimum number of samples a peak has to be present.
-   Parameters `minFraction` and `minSamples` depend on experimental layout!
-   `binSize` should be small enough that peaks from different ions measured at the
    same retention time would not be grouped together.
-   Interactive code: determine acceptable `bw` setting. Plot data for ions with
    same m/z and similar retention time: isomers Betaine and Valine ([M+H]+ m/z
    118.08625).

```{r  correspondence-bw, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Define correspondence settings to separate Methylhistidine peaks.", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10 }
par(mfrow = c(3, 1), mar = c(3, 4.3, 1, 1))

## Plot the chromatogram for an m/z slice containing Betaine and Valine
mzr <- 118.08625 + c(-0.01, 0.01)
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = mzr, aggregationFun = "max"))
highlightChromPeaks(data_cent, mz = mzr, whichPeaks = "apex_within")

## Correspondence in that slice using default settings
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group)
plotChromPeakDensity(data_cent, mz = mzr, param = pdp, type = "apex_within")

## Reducing the bandwidth
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8)
plotChromPeakDensity(data_cent, mz = mzr, param = pdp, type = "apex_within") 
```

-   Reducing the `bw` enables grouping of isomer peaks into different
    features.
-   Interactive code: perform the correspondence analysis.

```{r  correspondence-analysis, message = FALSE }
pdp <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = data_cent$group, bw = 1.8,
			minFraction = 0.4, binSize = 0.02)

## Perform the correspondence analysis
data_cent <- groupChromPeaks(data_cent, param = pdp) 
```

-   Evaluate results after correspondence: check for another slice with isomers:
    Leucine, Isoleucine ([M+H]+ m/z 132.10191). Setting `simulate = FALSE` shows the
    actual grouping results.

```{r  correspondence-evaluate, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Result of correspondence on a slice containing the isomers Leucine and Isoleucine.", fig.width = 10, fig.heigt = 8 }
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(3, 4.3, 1, 1))

## Plot the chromatogram for an m/z slice containing Leucine and Isoleucine
mzr <- 132.10191 + c(-0.01, 0.01)
plot(chromatogram(data_cent, mz = mzr, aggregationFun = "max"))
highlightChromPeaks(data_cent, mz = mzr, whichPeaks = "apex_within")

plotChromPeakDensity(data_cent, mz = mzr, param = pdp, type = "apex_within",
		     simulate = FALSE) 
```

-   Interactive code: inspect result object and extract feature intensities.

```{r  correspondence-result-object, message = FALSE }
## Get general information
data_cent

## Overview of the performed processings
processHistory(data_cent)

## Access the parameter class for a processing step
processParam(processHistory(data_cent)[[1]]) 
```

-   Interactive code: inspect definition of features and extract feature

intensities.

```{r  correspondence-feature-values, message = FALSE }
## Definition of the features
featureDefinitions(data_cent)

## Per-feature summary.
head(featureSummary(data_cent))

## feature intensity matrix
fmat <- featureValues(data_cent, value = "into", method = "maxint")
head(fmat) 
```

-   `featureValues` parameters:
    -   `value`: name of the column in `chromPeaks` that should be returned.
    -   `method`: for features with multiple peaks in one sample: from which peak the
        should the value be returned?

-   About missing values: peak detection may have failed. `fillChromPeaks` allows to
    fill in signal for missing peaks from the feature area (defined by the median
    rt and mz of all peaks assigned to the feature).
    Parameters:
    -   `expandMz`: expands the region from which signal is integrated in m/z
        dimension. A value of 0 means no expansion, 1 means the region is grown by
        half of the feature's m/z width on both sides.
    -   `expandRt`: expand the retention time window of the feature for integration.
    -   `ppm`: expand the m/z width by a m/z dependent value.
-   Interactive code: evaluate the number of missing peaks and use `fillChromPeaks`
    to retrieve a signal for them from the raw files.

```{r  fillChromPeaks, message = FALSE }
## Number of missing values
sum(is.na(fmat))

## Define the settings for the fill-in of missing peaks
fpp <- FillChromPeaksParam(expandMz = 0.5, expandRt = 0.5, ppm = 20)
data_cent <- fillChromPeaks(data_cent, param = fpp)

## How many missing values after
sum(is.na(featureValues(data_cent)))

fmat_fld <- featureValues(data_cent, value = "into", method = "maxint")
head(fmat_fld) 
```

-   Note: `dropFilledChromPeaks` removes filled-in peaks again.


# Summary
