# metabolomics2018
Workshop for the xcms(3) workshop at the metabolomics 2018 conference in
Seattle. The workshop provides an overview of recent developments in
Bioconductor to work with mass spectrometry
([MSnbase](https://github.com/lgatto/MSnbase)) and specifically LC-MS data
([xcms](https://github.com/sneumann/xcms)) and walks through the pre-processing
of a toy data set emphasizing on how to determine *good* data-dependent settings
for the individual pre-processing steps.

**Title**

Updated user interface of xcms for MS data representation and LC-MS data
pre-processing


Covered topics are:
- Data import and representation.
- Accessing, subsetting and visualizing data.
- Centroiding of profile MS data.
- Chromatographic peak detection.
- Empirically determine appropriate settings for the analyzed data set.
- Evaluation of identified peaks.
- Alignment (retention time correction).
- Correspondence (grouping of chromatographic peaks across samples).
- Evaluating and tuning certain correspondence parameters.
